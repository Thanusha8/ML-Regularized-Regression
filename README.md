# ML-Regularized-Regression
Comparing regularization methods to improve linear regression model performance.


This project compares different regularization techniques applied to linear regression models for predicting Boston housing prices. The models include:

- **Linear Regression** (baseline)
- **Ridge Regression** (L2 regularization)
- **Lasso Regression** (L1 regularization)  
- **ElasticNet** (L1 + L2 regularization)

## Results
- Linear Regression RMSE: 5.85
- Ridge Regression RMSE: 5.91
- Lasso Regression RMSE: 6.46
- ElasticNet RMSE: 6.38

Ridge regression performed best among regularized models, while standard linear regression had the lowest error.
